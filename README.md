How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    I look at the big picture,  what is the main problem that this application is going to solve for the client?
    Then I break down that problem into smaller parts to solve specific issues. I have done this extensively with designing business applications in relational databases.
    I learn what types of information will be flowing throught the system.  What are the key fields, how are they linked, and how is information getting into and out of the system.  
    I would build a data model, create the tables and relationships,  then begin to design the forms, reports and queries to make the system function.  Each item, no matter how small,  goes into an item on the Kanban board and assigned to a phase.  
    Writing down all of the tasks that need to be done, as you think of them,  helps to prevent items from falling throught the cracks and allows me to work in an efficient manner. 
    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    In the past I would just sit down and start to build.  Since taking formal programming courses, I have started to pre-plan using a flow chart or pseudo code.  Now I have the knowledge of Agile so I will begin to focus on small working solutions instead of a complete solution. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    A good team member is humble.  They know what they know and they know what they don't know.  The Agile method fosters sharing of knowledge so it's important for individuals not to be afraid to ask for help when they need it. 
    It's ok to strive for personal excellence so long as your personal aspirations do not interfere with the success of the team.  There are numerous sports metaphors I can use but this is my favorite:
    "Baseball! A man stands alone at the plate. This is the time for what? 
    For individual achievement. There he stands alone. But in the field, what? 
    Part of a team. 
    Teamwork. … Looks, throws, catches, hustles.Part of one big team. 
    If his team don’t field … what is he? You follow me? No one. 
    Sunny day, the stands are full of fans. What does he have to say? 
    I’m goin’ out there for myself. But … I get nowhere unless the team wins.
